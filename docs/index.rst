Open Platform for Local Energy Markets (OPLEM)
==========================================



Energy System Architecture Lab ESAL's OPLEM is a tool for modelling and testing LEM designs. The platform combines distributed energy resource modelling (e.g. for PV generation sources, battery energy storage systems, electric vehicles), power flow simulation, multi-period optimisation for scheduling flexible energy resources, and offers a modular and flexible framework to create and test market designs adapted for distribution networks. OPLEM comes with the same features as `OPEN <https://github.com/EPGOxford/OPEN>`_, which all combined cannot be found in existing tools, such as the multi-phase distribution network power flow, non-linear energy storage modelling, receding horizon and multi-period optimisation, separate models for control and simulation and the additional key feature of a generic market modelling that incorporates the common LEM designs and allows the user to develop their customised LEM designs.

The OPLEM code is available on GitHub `here <https://github.com/EsaLaboratory/OPLEM>`_.
